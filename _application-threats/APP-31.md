    ThreatCategory: "Malicious or privacy-invasive application"
    ID: APP-31
    Threat: "Malicious app impersonates a legitimate app"
    ThreatDescription: "3rd party apps may duplicate the appearance and interface of a legitimate app, such as a banking app, to trick the user into supplying authentication credentials or other sensitive information intended for the app being spoofed. This threat was facilitated on Android devices before 5.0, as a malicious app could determine if a target app was running in the foreground, then initiate an activity to gain focus and intercept credential entry by the user."
