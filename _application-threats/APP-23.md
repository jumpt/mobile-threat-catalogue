    ThreatCategory: "Malicious or privacy-invasive application"
    ID: APP-23
    Threat: "Abuse of device management functionality to ransom assets"
    ThreatDescription: "Device management features built into Android and iOS allow organizations to develop apps designed to enforce organizational mobile device security policies. Some policy options could be abused by a malicious app to block access to desired functionality (e.g. camera access) until a ransom is paid. Prior to Android 7.0, the Device Administrator role could forcefully set a device unlock code, which could be used to hold the entire device for ransom."
