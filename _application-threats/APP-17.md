    ID: APP-17
    Threat: "App silently intercepts SMS messages"
    ThreatDescription: "Prior to Android 4.4, apps granted permissions to SMS messaging functionality had the ability to listen for and receive incoming SMS messages. If the app was registered as the highest priority listener for messages, it could silently (without notice to the user) intercept, read, and dispose of messages intended for other apps. One serious abuse of this was the interception of one-time passwords (OTP) used for two-factor authentication (2FA) sent over SMS. Newer versions of Android do not permit apps with permission to access SMS messaging to receive or dispose of SMS messages directly. Unlike Android, the iOS security model does not permit apps with access to SMS messaging. Malicious apps may still realize this threat following exploitation of OS vulnerabilities that bypass access control on private SMS messaging APIs or achieve arbitrary code execution."
