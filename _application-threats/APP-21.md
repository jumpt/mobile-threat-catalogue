    ThreatCategory: "Malicious or privacy-invasive application"
    ID: APP-21
    Threat: "App vetting fails to detect malicious app code"
    ThreatDescription: "App vetting methods designed to detect malicious code are complicated by various code obfuscation techniques such as sandbox detection, encryption, and dead code (malicious functions unreachable by normal program execution). As a result, a malicious app subjected to app vetting may appear free of harmful code and safe to publish or distribute."
    ThreatOrigin: "Dissecting Android Malware: Characterization and Evolution [^85]"
    ExploitExample:
    CVEExample:
    - CVE-2015-07555
    - CVE-2016-5131
    PossibleCountermeasures:
        "Deploy MAM or MDM solutions with policies that prohibit the side-loading of apps, which may bypass security checks on the app.":
            - Enterprise
        "Use app-vetting tools or services to identify untrusted apps that contain encrypted or obfuscated code.":
            - Enterprise
        "Use Android Verify Apps feature to identify potentially harmful apps.":
            - Mobile Device User
        "Use application threat intelligence data about apps that contain encrypted or obfuscated code":
            - Enterprise
        "To mitigate your app being detected as potentially malicious, do not arbitrarily encrypt or obfuscate code.":
