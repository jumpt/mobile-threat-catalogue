    ThreatCategory: "Malicious or privacy-invasive application"
    ID: APP-36
    Threat: "Privacy invasive behaviors by pre-installed apps"
    ThreatDescription: "Mobile devices with cellular capability must generally be registered with a cellular carrier, and many devices are sold pre-configured to operate with a given carrier so users can have a fully functional device by the end of the initial purchase and activation at a retailer. As part of the configuration, the device may come with carrier-specific apps pre-installed, which may not be removable by the user. Because these apps come pre-installed, they may also may be granted implicit permission to access device resources without explicit knowledge or consent of the device owner. Privacy violations by such pre-installed apps may be more difficult to mitigate than by user-installed apps, which can be uninstalled at any time."

            - Enterprise
        "Uninstall pre-installed apps that are not in use.":
            - Mobile Device User
        "For pre-installed apps that cannot be uninstalled, revoke access to device sensors and OS-provided services.":
            - Mobile Device User
        "For pre-installed apps that cannot be uninstalled, disable the app so that it cannot be launched.":
            - Mobile Device User
        "Deploy MAM solutions to identify and block access to devices running high-risk pre-installed apps.":
            - Enterprise
        "Deploy MAM or container solutions to provide additional separation between trusted and untrusted pre-installed apps to mitigate the potential for pre-installed apps to violate the privacy of user actions performed within trusted apps.":
