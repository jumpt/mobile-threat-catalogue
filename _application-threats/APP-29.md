    ThreatCategory: "Malicious or privacy-invasive application"
    ID: APP-29
    Threat: "Command-and-control messaging evades traffic analysis"
    ThreatDescription: "Mobile OS offer built-in and encrypted communication channels that may appear to be normal traffic or occur out-of-band (over a cellular connection), thereby evading detection by Wi-Fi-based enterprise traffic analysis tools. Google offers Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) and newly, Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), which provides two-way communication. Apple offers the Apple Push Notification Service (APNS), which offers one-way communication from server-to-device. Both services are commonly used within mobile apps, which makes detecting abuse of these services difficult."
