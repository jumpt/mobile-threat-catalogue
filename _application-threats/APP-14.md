    ID: APP-14
    Threat: "Trojan app impersonates a legitimate app"
    ThreatDescription: "Like well-behaved apps, a trojan app offers some functionality to the user, though a trojan also includes hidden functionality that is malicious or otherwise undesirable. One technique for deploying trojan functionality is to obtain the install packages for a legitimate app, decompile/disassemble it, introduce the trojan, and then generate a new install package. The app will appear to a user to be the legitimate app. Distribution of trojans is commonly achieved by submission to open 3rd party app stores or social engineering attacks claiming to offer users the app with incentives (lower cost, free, extras unlocked, etc.)."
