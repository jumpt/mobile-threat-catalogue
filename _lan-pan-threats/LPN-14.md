    Threat: "Bluejacking - sending unsolicited messages to a bluetooth-enabled mobile device"
    ThreatDescription: "The Bluetooth specification supports the transfer of certain object types defined in the OBEX protocol, namedly vCard (contacts), vCal (calendar events) and vNote (text). OBEX does not require authentication, and messages can be sent to Bluetooth-enabled devices without any prerequisite pairing or authentication. While unsolicited messages are not directly harmful to the device, they may facilitate social engineering attacks if a recipient accepts crafted contact or calendar information sent by an attacker."
