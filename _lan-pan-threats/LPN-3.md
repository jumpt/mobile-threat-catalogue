    PossibleCountermeasures:
        "When choosing to connect to an unencrypted and potentially spoofed Wi-Fi network, to reduce the probability of connecting to a malicious network, verify the network appears consistently geolocated with the host (e.g., on the premises), and if possible, verify with a representative that the intended Wi-Fi network is the one they host.":
            - Mobile Device User
        "To decrease the probability of connecting to a spoofed Wi-Fi network, configure devices to not automatically connect to unknown Wi-Fi networks, and to \'forget\' public networks once they are no longer in use.":
            - Mobile Device User
        "To greatly decrease the probability of this attack, only allow mobile devices to connect to authorized Wi-Fi networks that use WPA2 encryption with a strong pre-shared key (for personal mode).":
