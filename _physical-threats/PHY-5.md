    ThreatCategory: Physical Access
    ID: PHY-5
    Threat: "Use of a sidechannel attack to obtain crypto private keys"
    ThreatOrigin: "ECDSA Key Extraction from Mobile Devices Via Nonintrusive Physical Side Channels"
    ExploitExample: 
        - "New Attack Steals Secret Crypto Keys from Android and iOS Phones [^164]"
        - "Evolving differential power analysis targets SIM cards [^Rambus-1]"
    CVEExample:
    PossibleCountermeasures:
        "To increase the difficulty of this attack, use devices that implement mitigations in their cryptograhic functions against side-channel attacks, such as iOS 9.x and later devices.":
            - Mobile Device User
            - Enterprise
        "Avoid the use of apps that may implement their own cryptographic functions without validation that appropriate mitigations against side-channel attacks have been implemented.":
            - Enterprise
        "Educate users to be mindful of their physical surroundings when using mobile devices, and to report the appearance of unexpected hardware components to IT security immediately.":
            - Enterprise
        "Educate users to not directly connect their mobile devices to untrusted systems or docking stations, and to maintain strong physical security for innocent components such as USB charging cables":
            - Enterprise
