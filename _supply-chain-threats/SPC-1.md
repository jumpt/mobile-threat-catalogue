    Threat: "A hardware or firmware component can be intercepted by an adversary while in transit between supplier and acquirer, for the purpose of substitution or manipulation. Vulnerabilities: The distribution channels are susceptible to hardware or firmware"
    ThreatOrigin: "Supply Chain Attack Framework and Attack Patterns [^142]"
    ExploitExample:
    CVEExample:
    PossibleCountermeasures:
        "Require firmware to be digitally signed by a trusted developer and the signature verified prior to the component being integrated into a larger system":
            - Enterprise                        
        "Employ software integrity verification checks on installed firmware, which can be validated against a known-good value (e.g. brute-force resistant cryptographic hash of firmware image) to detect any modification to firmware":
            - Enterprise
        "Obtain device measurements for comparison to normal ranges (e.g., temperature, timing, EM radiation, power consumption) to detect anomalous behavior.":
